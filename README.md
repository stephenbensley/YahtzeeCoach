# YahtzeeCoach

YahtzeeCoach is an iOS app that lets you play a solo game of [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) and provides feedback on your moves. The top level directories are:
- Coach: the iOS app
- Data: contains the precomputed solution file
- Solver: a MacOS app that solves the game of Yahtzee offline and saves the results to a file
- Tests: unit tests
- Yahtzee: core Yahtzee logic &mdash; shared between Coach and Solver

The iOS app is still a work in progress. The Solver is complete.
