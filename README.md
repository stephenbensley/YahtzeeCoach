# YahtzeeCoach

YahtzeeCoach is an iOS app that lets you play a solo game of [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) and provides feedback on your moves. The top level directories are:
- Coach: the iOS app
- Resources: contains the precomputed solution file and the content for the About and Help views
- Solver: a MacOS app that solves the game of Yahtzee offline and saves the results to a file
- Tests: unit tests
- Yahtzee: core Yahtzee logic &mdash; shared between Coach and Solver

The iOS app hasn't been released yet, but it's fully operational and reasonably well tested.
