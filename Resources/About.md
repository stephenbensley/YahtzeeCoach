**Credits**
This app was inspired by [An Optimal Strategy for Yahtzee](http://gunpowder.cs.loyola.edu/~jglenn/research/optimal_yahtzee.pdf) by James Glenn and [Optimal Solitaire Yahtzee Player](http://www-set.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/misc/yahtzee/osyp.php) by Tom Verhoeff. I did not use or even look at their source code, so any bugs in this app are entirely my own. However, all three of us arrived at the same solution for the expected score of solitaire Yahtzee with perfect play, so I'm confident that my code is correct. 

**Source Code**
The source code for the app is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stephenbensley/YatzyCoach) and is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/stephenbensley/YatzyCoach/blob/main/LICENSE).
